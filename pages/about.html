        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello My name is Edward Cochran. I'm currently 33 years old. Did you know that is 231 in dog years? If you can't tell by now, I'm also an animal lover. I’m an entrepreneur with a diverse background in technical problem-solving and hands-on expertise. I currently run two businesses, one as an RV Technician and the other as a Scuba Instructor. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to develop strong technical skills, navigating complex systems and delivering solutions in both the RV industry and the world of scuba diving. Whether I’m diagnosing and repairing intricate RV systems or leading scuba expeditions, I’ve learned how to think critically, adapt quickly, and find creative solutions to unexpected challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I've enjoyed the challenges and rewards of these industries, my true passion has always been in software engineering. I’ve decided to take the leap and transition into this field, driven by my desire to build something new, improve processes, and contribute to the growing tech world. My goal is to combine the problem-solving mindset I’ve developed through entrepreneurship with my newfound skills in coding to create impactful software solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my technical background, I’m focused on gaining a better work-life balance and financial stability. I’m aiming for a remote software engineering role, which will allow me the flexibility to work from anywhere while doing what I love. I’m excited about this new chapter and ready to take on the challenges that come with it. If you're interested in connecting or collaborating, feel free to reach out!
